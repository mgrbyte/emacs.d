=================================================
Another Opinionated Emacs Development Environment
=================================================
A bunch of emacs-lisp_ tailored for Python_ and lisp_ web development.

One of the primary motivations for this package is to provide a consistent,
useful development environment.

It is also opinionated, providing mode hooks for a host of extensions.

Each of these can of course been overridden/configured as you prefer.

use-package_ is used to configure the default set of packages that will be installed.

See the use-package_ statements in ``.emacs.d/init.el``.

This Emacs_ setup assumes Emacs 24 or higher.

Cask_  is used for package management and installation

Please see the documentation in docs_ for installation, custom configuration and more.

Read HACKING.rst_ for a guide on developing emacs.d_.
